# Railpack Configuration for Resume Tweaker (Go)
# Declarative build configuration - the Railway/Arch way!

# Note: Railpack auto-detects Go projects via go.mod
# This file may not be needed, but documents our approach

# If needed, Go packages can be specified:
# [packages]
# go = "1.23"

# Go builds to static binary - no native dependency complexity!
# Much simpler than the Elixir version (no Rust, no GLIBC issues)
